# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

Date: 20/03/2021

Project done as part of the Computational Physics course in the master program of Applied Physics at Delft University of Technology. This project is about a set of particles interacting via the Lennard Jones potential. The evolution is modeled using the Verlet algorithm. Observable quantities such as the diffusion constant, pressure, autocorrelation function and pair correlation functions are calculated with its associated error.

Important note: files inside `examples/` required to executed in a Unix system since they rely on a symbolic link. For a windows system, copy the files to the root directory of the project as `cp examples/pair_correlation.ipynb .`.

# Final report

The final report can be found in the directory `docs/manuscript/`. The figures of this report can be generated using the notebooks from `examples/`. The notebooks used are:
* `pressure.ipynb`
* `pair_correlation.ipynb`
* `two_particles.ipynb`
