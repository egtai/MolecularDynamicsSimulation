def normal_autocorr(mu, sigma, tau, N):
    """Generates an autocorrelated sequence of Gaussian random numbers.
    
    Each of the random numbers in the sequence of length `N` is distributed
    according to a Gaussian with mean `mu` and standard deviation `sigma` (just
    as in `numpy.random.normal`, with `loc=mu` and `scale=sigma`). Subsequent
    random numbers are correlated such that the autocorrelation function
    is on average `exp(-n/tau)` where `n` is the distance between random
    numbers in the sequence.
    
    This function implements the algorithm described in
    https://www.cmu.edu/biolphys/deserno/pdf/corr_gaussian_random.pdf
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    mu: float
        mean of each Gaussian random number
    sigma: float
        standard deviation of each Gaussian random number
    tau: float
        autocorrelation time
    N: int
        number of desired random numbers
    
    Returns:
    --------
    sequence: numpy array
        array of autocorrelated random numbers
